A simple implementation of linked list

1. Has the following basic interface:

1.1 Add: creates a new node and adds it to the end of the list  
1.2 First: searches the list for a given string. Returns the first node 
containing that string, if there are any  
1.3 Single: searches the list for a given string. Returns the node containing the string, if only one node was found. Returns error in all other cases  
1.4 Delete: removes selected node from the list 
1.6 ToArray: returns an array with all the values contained in the list


2. There are two implementations of the list:

2.1 A singly linked list (each node has a reference to the next node).  
2.2 A doubly linked list (each node has a reference to both the next and previous 
nodes).
